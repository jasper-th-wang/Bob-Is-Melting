# Bob Is Melting

Bob is Melting is a 2D platformer game with an objective centered around preventing Bob the Snowman, from fully melting away. You will be hopping around a map where snowballs just pop up out of nowhere. Scooping up these snowballs is key because Bob's got a bit of a melting problemâ€”his health ticks down bit by bit, just like a real snowman on a sunny day. Your job is to bring those snowballs back to Bob to patch him up and keep the melt at bay.
